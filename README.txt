  ElectroMagnetic workbench for FreeCAD
=========================================


Project for building an ElectroMagnetic workbench for FreeCAD. FreeCAD is a free 3D parametric CAD.
FreeCAD is used as pre-processor interfacing to the electromagnetic field solver.
At present, this is just a macro for creating an input file for the FasterCap capacitance solver by FastFieldSolvers S.R.L.

The macro must be loaded into FreeCAD, see www.freecadweb.org

For FasterCap and additional information please visit http://www.fastfieldsolvers.com/
Access to the download pages is free, and you may access anonymously if you want.
